#Here we create a new Song instance. Remember, there was no initialize method defined 
#in the Song class itself -- it is inherited from the InteractiveRecord class.
#After the Song instance is created, information about the song's name and album is 
#printed out with puts. The song instance is then saved to the database.
#Just to make sure everything is working, Song.find_by_name("Hello") is used to search 
#the database for the newly created song. When ruby bin/run is run in your
puts Song.find_by_name("Hello")
#after puts Song.find_by _name("Hello") is executed we should get 
# song name: Hello
# song album: 25
# {"id"=>1, "name"=>"Hello", "album"=>"25"}


# !!!!!!!!NOTE!!!!!!!! The #initialize, #save and #find_by_name methods used by 
# Song here were inherited from InteractiveRecord.
